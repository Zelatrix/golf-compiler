- At this moment in time, functions with no arguments work correctly. Code such as 

```
function fun() {
	var x := 2;
	print(x);
}
```
can be compiled and run successfully. Global variables are partially implemented. This branch pushes global variables to the back of the queue and focuses on implementing functions with 1 or more arguments, such as

```
function fun(x) {
	print(x);
}
```

- Error handling has also been improved, with dedicated error classes for each type of error, including an error to handle compilation of a file that doesn't exist, so that it becomes more obvious what the problem is. Examples of error classes include:

- LexerError
- ParserError
- CodeGenError
- FileNotExistsError
